								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="MikeGuglielmucci" src="http://chrislewisblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/blj.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180" />Studies show that approximately 45% of men are diagnosed with cancer at some point in their life. But an even bigger struggle for men is the battle with pornography. Studies show that approximately 53% of men have battled with pornography.</p>
<p>My inspiration for writing this is a worship leader that battled cancer and claimed healing from God. After becoming fairly popular from his story and his music about his battle, it was <a href="http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/pastors-secret-life-of-sin/story-0-1111117283342">revealed</a> that he didn&#8217;t actually have cancer, but had been involved in a life of lies to convince everyone around him that he was sick. As the truth came out, the true battle that he was fighting was the battle with pornography.</p>
<p>This story of lies and deception has really bugged me since I learned about it a year and a half ago. Since the truth came out, the song this guy wrote has increasingly become popular. And this popularity in light of the lies surrounding the song, has really caused conflict in my heart as I&#8217;ve sung this song. It has really agonized me.</p>
<p>But tonight I realized this guy who wrote the song was really seeking healing from his &#8216;cancer&#8217; that he was too embarrassed and ashamed to talk about. It was not a cancer of the body, but a cancer of the mind and soul. Pornography had infected him and was causing him tremendous pain. That same pain has hurt more men than any actual cancer of the body. And I can attest that God can heal men from this battle with pornography.</p>
<p>Now when I sing the song <a href="http://s0.ilike.com/play#Hillsong:Healer:96594354:s28320032.8102736.5007123.0.1.34%2Cstd_e22f9431a5a5166d278f9401b475b3f9"><strong><em>Healer</em></strong></a>, it&#8217;ll have a different meaning. It&#8217;s not just a plea for physical healing of our bodies, but a healing of our hearts, souls, and minds. Below are some of the lyrics from this plea for healing:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I believe You&#8217;re my Healer<br />
I believe You are all I need<br />
I believe You&#8217;re my Portion<br />
I believe You&#8217;re more than enough for me<br />
Jesus You&#8217;re all I need<br />
Nothing is impossible for You<br />
You hold my world in Your hands</em></p></blockquote>
<p><em><strong>God, I pray for all men that are battling pornography. I pray that they will seek your healing and support with this battle. Nothing, not even a battle with pornography, is impossible for You.</strong></em></p>
