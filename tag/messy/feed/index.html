								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About a month and a half ago I was driving home from somewhere and was thinking about my two boys. I was basically being impressed that I should be praying for the two guys. As I was thinking and praying about praying for them, I was hit by a deep thought that wasn&#8217;t part of me. I realized that I often pray for things to be simpler and less chaotic with my boys. &#8220;God, help tonight be an uneventful night. I don&#8217;t need extra drama tonight, so can you help things go smoothly?&#8221; Maybe you can relate to that sort of prayer.</p>
<p>Well, below is a recording of my thoughts and insights about praying for my kids. Take a quick listen.<br />

<p><strong><em>How about you? Do you have any messy prayers for your kids?</em></strong></p>
<p>Would love to hear your thoughts in the comments.</p>
