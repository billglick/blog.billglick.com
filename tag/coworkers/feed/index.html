								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was telling a friend just last night (or maybe the night before) about an opportunity that I felt like I&#8217;d missed out on.  I ran into an aquaintance last week that I hadn&#8217;t seen in several months. We were making small talk and he asked something about my church.  Afterwards I realized that I think he was opening the door to me inviting him to church or to take the conversation a bit deeper.  So, I was commenting to my friend that I felt like I&#8217;d blown the opportunity that God had placed before me &#8212; in fact I didn&#8217;t even recognize the opportunity till after it had passed.  Yeah, I&#8217;m slow.</p>
<p>Well today I&#8217;m out to lunch with my coworkers and I see this same aquaintance come walking into the restaurant.  We eventually make eye contact across the crowded room and exchange friendly waves.  So, after lunch I went over and said hello again.  I think I said something about it was odd to run into him again so soon.  Then I took off back to work.  Like I said&#8230; I&#8217;m slow.</p>
<p>So, tonight as I&#8217;m thinking about my day it hits me&#8230; God crossed our paths again today for some reason.  Maybe it was for me to open the door a bit more with this guy.  Or maybe it was just so I&#8217;d start to recognize opportunities that He puts in my day.  Whatever the reason, God&#8217;s funny that way.  He orchestrated my day and this other guy&#8217;s day so that we&#8217;d run into each other, just a day after I&#8217;d realized the first meeting was a God opportunity.  God is funny.</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ll take advantage of the opportunity if I run into this guy again in the next few days.  But, the bigger question is&#8230; <em><strong>How can I better recognize God opportunities when they show up?</strong></em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At work recently we&#8217;ve been trying to get a better handle on how we use our time.  My goal has been to document my time usage in 15 minute increments throughout the day.  But, obviously this could quickly become a tedious task that is counter productive.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had an idea to simplify this task.  I setup a new <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a> account specifically for this task.  Then I downloaded a <a href="http://funkatron.com/spaz">Twitter client</a> and setup a cron entry to automatically open the twitter client every 15 minutes throughout my work day. So now documenting my work day is pretty unobtrusive. And if my coworkers ever want a glimpse of what I&#8217;m up to, they can simply subscribe to my <a href="http://twitter.com/billglick_ncsa">Twitter feed</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been auditing my work time in a similar manner for the past couple of weeks and have found this extremely valuable.  I&#8217;m finding 4 main benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>I feel pressured to be more productive so I actually have something to include in my entries. It&#8217;s a kind of accountability.</li>
<li>I can quickly review my week so that preparing status reports for management is easier.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m seeing areas where I get bogged down and am unproductive, as well as times of day that I&#8217;m simply wasting time or goofing off.</li>
<li>I have a historical log so that I can diagnose issues down the road. Lots of times we&#8217;ll see where one of our systems started having problems on a certain date or time; and now it&#8217;s easier to recall what might have changed during that particular time frame.</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">Have you ever found it useful to track your work and time in this much detail?</span></span></p>
<p><em><strong>Do you have any other creative uses for Twitter.com?</strong></em></p>
