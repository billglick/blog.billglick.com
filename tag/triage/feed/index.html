								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the fifth and final part in my series on <a href="/2008/06/13/5-lessons-from-katrina/">5 life lessons</a> that I learned from Labor Day weekend in 2005, while volunteering with efforts after Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d come to serve these poor people.  I wasn&#8217;t sure what tasks lay ahead.  I knew some people were injured &#8212; maybe I&#8217;d work in triage wrapping bandages.  I knew people were here without money and food &#8212; maybe I&#8217;d work a food line.  Maybe I&#8217;d setup cots or give out clothes or cut branches or unload supplies or clean porta-potties.  I was willing to do whatever.  It&#8217;d likely be hard and probably push me out of my comfort zone.  I didn&#8217;t know how to encourage and support people after such a terrible event.  What if I needed to help in the clinic and had to touch someone&#8217;s blood?  Oh well, I want to make a difference and I guess it will be worth it.</p>
<p>Little did I expect that I&#8217;d be surfing the internet, creating online web forms, using my wireless laptop, configuring simple networks, and other geeky stuff that I always enjoy doing.</p>
<p>God has an amazing way of using our passions to serve with.  It&#8217;s great to be willing to do whatever for the glory of God.  But since God created us intentionally he&#8217;ll generally use the passions and skills that he wired into us to bring glory to him.  That&#8217;s part of what makes serving so much fun.</p>
<p><em><strong>How have you seen God work through the skills and passions that He&#8217;s given you?  Did that surprise you?</strong></em></p>
