								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This past year has definitely been the hardest year of my life.  At the same time it&#8217;s been my most defining and best year.  Today I begin a series of posts to help me look at the past year and document what I&#8217;ve been learning through various hardships.</p>
<p>It actually started over a year ago. In October 2006 God really started challenging my faith and belief.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Bill, if you believe that faith in Jesus is key to people finding hope, forgiveness and eternal life, why don&#8217;t you seem to care? Why don&#8217;t you care about people?  People who are far from God?  People you work with?  People from church?  Family?  Bill, what have I called you to?  Didn&#8217;t I say love me and love the people around you?  I didn&#8217;t call you to some other mission.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I never heard an audible voice or anything, but God started putting that burden on my heart last fall.</p>
<p>So, life lesson number 1: <strong>Relationships matter everything.</strong> God&#8217;s core desire for us is to know Him and share our lives with people around us (see: <a href="http://youversion.com/reader.php?startverse=Matt.22.36">Greatest Commandment</a>).  If those relationships aren&#8217;t at the core of what I&#8217;m doing, I&#8217;m not really in the game.  This wasn&#8217;t really new to me, but the newness was an understanding and appreciation that God sets this as <em>the</em> top priority.</p>
<p>So, in October 2006 I started to move toward investing in relationships as a core focus. There are times when I&#8217;ve gotten off track and sat on the bench, forgetting how to play the game, but this new passion for relationships has been the basis for making the past year incredible.  You&#8217;ll hear about some of these new relationships in future parts of this post.<br />
<em></em></p>
<p><em><strong>What about you? Do you really let the value of relationships be the top priority in your life?</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Do you have any advice for keeping this a core focus in your life?</strong></em></p>
