								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-68" title="My Mom" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/connie00351-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/connie00351-200x300.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2008/08/connie00351.jpg 1248w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;d do almost anything for my mom if I know she really needs my help.  If an emergency comes up, I&#8217;ll take off from work and drive 100 miles to go be with her at the drop of a hat.  She&#8217;s family and I love her.  And I&#8217;ll do just about anything to help my family when they&#8217;re in serious need.</p>
<p>As an unmarried, only child, my physical family is pretty small.  But, as a child of God, my family is ginormous. God asks us to live life together as a family and share and help one another as need arises.  Unfortunately, either I often don&#8217;t see the needs of my family, or my family doesn&#8217;t express their needs to me.  But, I know various people in my family are hurting and needing help.  How can I better realize their needs and help them in both practical ways and lifting them in prayer?  I want to grow in this area.</p>
<p>Last week my mom had several physical needs and I took off several days from work to help her and be at her side.  About the same time, I learned of 3 families at church who had deaths of close friends and family.  And I also learned about 2 marriages that were going through some pretty rough times.  Normally I&#8217;d probably say a quick prayer for these situations, but this past week God has somewhat broken me over these hurts and needs.  I&#8217;ve actually spent many different times praying and crying over these hurts and needs of my &#8216;family&#8217; members.  It&#8217;s been an eye and heart opening experience to be broken by these hurts.  I want to continue to grow in noticing and helping my family.</p>
<p><em><strong>Lord, continue to work in my life so that I&#8217;m broken when my family is broken.  Help me to notice when my family is hurting and broken.  Help me to grow in my willingness and passion in practically praying and assisting when my family needs help.  And, continue to lift up and strengthen these 6 groups of people in my family.  I especially ask you to bless these 2 troubled marriages, as well as 2 others that came to mind tonight.  Touch them in a mighty and miraculous way as only you can!</strong></em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the third part in my series on <a href="/2008/06/13/5-lessons-from-katrina/">5 life lessons</a> that I learned from Labor Day weekend in 2005, while volunteering with efforts after Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p>It was the end of our first day working at the River Centre shelter.  We&#8217;d driven through the night the day before and I was now working on only about 6 hours sleep for the past 48 hours.  I was exhausted and at the end of my rope.  But, we now had a 5 year old boy latched onto us who needed some love and attention.</p>
<p>His mother had left the shelter that morning around 10a and he didn&#8217;t know where his mom was.  It was now about 9 hours later and we didn&#8217;t want to leave this boy alone.  I&#8217;d already sent most of our team off to find the place where we were supposed to be sleeping, but now after searching for his mom for about 90 minutes I was at the end of what I could handle.</p>
<p>In selfish desperation, I said a short prayer&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Lord, if there&#8217;s any way possible, it&#8217;d sure be nice if this boy&#8217;s mother could show up here in the next couple of minutes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Literally about 90 seconds later I see 2 women walking in and this boy going to them.  It was the boy&#8217;s mother and aunt.  God had answered my simple prayer.  I couldn&#8217;t believe it.  The timing was just too weird to not have been God&#8217;s personal response to me.</p>
<p>So, why do I tend to only turn to God and ask for his help as a last resort?  Why do I think I have to solve things on my own and exhaust all other resources, before turning to God?  It&#8217;s either that I don&#8217;t trust him, or I&#8217;m too proud to feel like I need his help.  Either option is stupid.</p>
<p><em>Lord, help me to come to you with my daily needs.  Help me to trust and depend on you in both the little and big stuff of life.  Without you I&#8217;m not all that hot, and I need your help.</em></p>
<p><strong>Do you have any stories of when God answered a really simple prayer of yours?  Do you have trouble asking for help with the simpler needs in your life?</strong></p>
