								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently I&#8217;ve been putting a lot of thought into why I actually do, or don&#8217;t do, things.  I mean, why is it that I a tend to live an undisciplined life?  Why do I not want to do my laundry, wash dishes, lose weight, eat healthy, etc.?  You&#8217;re issues may be different, but I bet there are things that you feel like you should do, but have a hard time following through with them.</p>
<p>Last week an idea really clicked with me.  Living a disciplined life should not be the goal.  Rather a discipline is something that I do so that I can live a certain way.  The act of taking out the garbage isn&#8217;t my goal.  Eating healthy isn&#8217;t my goal.  Rather those are things that I do so that I can live life and not get distracted by those things.</p>
<p>So, what are some of my goals?  I want to live a life full of passion.  I want to be connected in meaningful relationships with people.  I want to help people experience a meaningful life.  So, I need to strategically lead my own life so that things don&#8217;t distract me from these goals.  That&#8217;s where discipline enters the picture.</p>
<p>I want to focus on a few disciplines that help me to not get distracted from my goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>By spending time in God&#8217;s Word, I can learn from His passion.</li>
<li>By focusing on my health, I can live more vigorously and invest more freely in relationships.</li>
<li>By studying and reading, I can develop skills in leading people.</li>
</ul>
<p>I need to understand what my motivation is.  It&#8217;s so easy to get caught up in a task and forget why it&#8217;s even important.</p>
<p><strong><em>Where have you lost your motivation recently?  What is an area of your life you want to grow in, and how can a discipline help with it?</em></strong></p>
