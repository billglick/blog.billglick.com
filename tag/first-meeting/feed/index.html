								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was telling a friend just last night (or maybe the night before) about an opportunity that I felt like I&#8217;d missed out on.  I ran into an aquaintance last week that I hadn&#8217;t seen in several months. We were making small talk and he asked something about my church.  Afterwards I realized that I think he was opening the door to me inviting him to church or to take the conversation a bit deeper.  So, I was commenting to my friend that I felt like I&#8217;d blown the opportunity that God had placed before me &#8212; in fact I didn&#8217;t even recognize the opportunity till after it had passed.  Yeah, I&#8217;m slow.</p>
<p>Well today I&#8217;m out to lunch with my coworkers and I see this same aquaintance come walking into the restaurant.  We eventually make eye contact across the crowded room and exchange friendly waves.  So, after lunch I went over and said hello again.  I think I said something about it was odd to run into him again so soon.  Then I took off back to work.  Like I said&#8230; I&#8217;m slow.</p>
<p>So, tonight as I&#8217;m thinking about my day it hits me&#8230; God crossed our paths again today for some reason.  Maybe it was for me to open the door a bit more with this guy.  Or maybe it was just so I&#8217;d start to recognize opportunities that He puts in my day.  Whatever the reason, God&#8217;s funny that way.  He orchestrated my day and this other guy&#8217;s day so that we&#8217;d run into each other, just a day after I&#8217;d realized the first meeting was a God opportunity.  God is funny.</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ll take advantage of the opportunity if I run into this guy again in the next few days.  But, the bigger question is&#8230; <em><strong>How can I better recognize God opportunities when they show up?</strong></em></p>
