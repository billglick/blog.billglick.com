								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently I&#8217;ve been putting a lot of thought into why I actually do, or don&#8217;t do, things.  I mean, why is it that I a tend to live an undisciplined life?  Why do I not want to do my laundry, wash dishes, lose weight, eat healthy, etc.?  You&#8217;re issues may be different, but I bet there are things that you feel like you should do, but have a hard time following through with them.</p>
<p>Last week an idea really clicked with me.  Living a disciplined life should not be the goal.  Rather a discipline is something that I do so that I can live a certain way.  The act of taking out the garbage isn&#8217;t my goal.  Eating healthy isn&#8217;t my goal.  Rather those are things that I do so that I can live life and not get distracted by those things.</p>
<p>So, what are some of my goals?  I want to live a life full of passion.  I want to be connected in meaningful relationships with people.  I want to help people experience a meaningful life.  So, I need to strategically lead my own life so that things don&#8217;t distract me from these goals.  That&#8217;s where discipline enters the picture.</p>
<p>I want to focus on a few disciplines that help me to not get distracted from my goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>By spending time in God&#8217;s Word, I can learn from His passion.</li>
<li>By focusing on my health, I can live more vigorously and invest more freely in relationships.</li>
<li>By studying and reading, I can develop skills in leading people.</li>
</ul>
<p>I need to understand what my motivation is.  It&#8217;s so easy to get caught up in a task and forget why it&#8217;s even important.</p>
<p><strong><em>Where have you lost your motivation recently?  What is an area of your life you want to grow in, and how can a discipline help with it?</em></strong></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a hard time coming up with good visual backgrounds to go along with song lyrics.  It seems like it&#8217;s easy to find backgrounds that are either boring, irrelevant, or distracting.</p>
<p>For a couple of years I&#8217;ve been thinking there has to be some way to have dynamically created animations to use as song backgrounds. Several months ago I came across some Quartz Composer animations that were controlled via sound.  But, I hadn&#8217;t been able to figure out how to use any of these animations in real time with our presentation software.</p>
<p><a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_AtjH03n8TIM/Rq664oWXk6I/AAAAAAAAAto/vs_Hl_BgG2k/s1600-h/songvisualization.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5093213710669288354" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_AtjH03n8TIM/Rq664oWXk6I/AAAAAAAAAto/vs_Hl_BgG2k/s320/songvisualization.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>So, finally last week I decided I was going to experiment with using some sound triggered Quartz Composer animations for song backgrounds.  After a few hours I finally setup a video camera to capture my Mac&#8217;s screen animation and feed the video into our presentation software via a live firewire feed.  It was clunky and awkward to control, but it worked and looked nice.  Unfortunately, I only really found one useful Quartz Composer animation to use, <a href="http://pcheese.net/software/soundstream/">Soundstream</a>.  So, I&#8217;m not ready to put it into regular use, but I proved it was worth exploring some more.</p>
<p>So, has anyone else used any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_visualization">music visualization</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_VJ_software">VJ</a> software to create song backgrounds?  Any advice you can share?</p>
