								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At work recently we&#8217;ve been trying to get a better handle on how we use our time.  My goal has been to document my time usage in 15 minute increments throughout the day.  But, obviously this could quickly become a tedious task that is counter productive.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had an idea to simplify this task.  I setup a new <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a> account specifically for this task.  Then I downloaded a <a href="http://funkatron.com/spaz">Twitter client</a> and setup a cron entry to automatically open the twitter client every 15 minutes throughout my work day. So now documenting my work day is pretty unobtrusive. And if my coworkers ever want a glimpse of what I&#8217;m up to, they can simply subscribe to my <a href="http://twitter.com/billglick_ncsa">Twitter feed</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been auditing my work time in a similar manner for the past couple of weeks and have found this extremely valuable.  I&#8217;m finding 4 main benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>I feel pressured to be more productive so I actually have something to include in my entries. It&#8217;s a kind of accountability.</li>
<li>I can quickly review my week so that preparing status reports for management is easier.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m seeing areas where I get bogged down and am unproductive, as well as times of day that I&#8217;m simply wasting time or goofing off.</li>
<li>I have a historical log so that I can diagnose issues down the road. Lots of times we&#8217;ll see where one of our systems started having problems on a certain date or time; and now it&#8217;s easier to recall what might have changed during that particular time frame.</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">Have you ever found it useful to track your work and time in this much detail?</span></span></p>
<p><em><strong>Do you have any other creative uses for Twitter.com?</strong></em></p>
