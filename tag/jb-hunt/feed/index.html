								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-67" title="J.B. Hunt" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/truckloadpanel-300x139.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="139" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/truckloadpanel-300x139.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2008/08/truckloadpanel.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Last week I was reminded that in January of 1994 I&#8217;d signed up to attend the JB Hunt truck driving school.  I was totally into truck driving and the transportation industry back then, and I was searching for where God was wanting to lead me professionally and personally.  If I remember correctly, attending that truck driving school required me to drive for JB Hunt for the next 3 years after graduating.  For some reason I changed my mind about 10 days before the school was to begin.</p>
<p>A month ago I was also remembering how I&#8217;d signed up for the Navy ROTC program when I was a college freshman.  I&#8217;d initially applied for NROTC for the tuition scholarship that came with the program.  But, I ended up getting another full scholarship that didn&#8217;t require me to sign over my life after college.  So, after the first 2 weeks of college and NROTC, I began to question why I was still in NROTC and ended up dropping out of it before I had any commitment to our US military.</p>
<p>While &#8216;signing over&#8217; a few years of your life to a trucking company or to the military might not sound like your cup of tea, I think either experience could have been good for me.  I&#8217;m sure my life would have been both better and worse from either experience and I&#8217;d likely be in a whole different situation, better or worse, than I am now.</p>
<p>I really like where I am now.  It&#8217;s not perfect, but it&#8217;s good and God has definitely worked some big stuff in my life over the past few years.  I don&#8217;t regret any of the big life-choices I&#8217;ve made, but I sometimes just wonder how things might have been different.</p>
<p><em><strong>God, thanks for leading me along my life&#8217;s journey.  Often times life&#8217;s choices are hard and unclear, but you are willing to offer us guidance and wisdom about such decisions.  Thanks so much for your guidance in my life.  I can&#8217;t wait to see what lies ahead along our path!</strong></em></p>
