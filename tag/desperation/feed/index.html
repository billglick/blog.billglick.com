								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the third part in my series on <a href="/2008/06/13/5-lessons-from-katrina/">5 life lessons</a> that I learned from Labor Day weekend in 2005, while volunteering with efforts after Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p>It was the end of our first day working at the River Centre shelter.  We&#8217;d driven through the night the day before and I was now working on only about 6 hours sleep for the past 48 hours.  I was exhausted and at the end of my rope.  But, we now had a 5 year old boy latched onto us who needed some love and attention.</p>
<p>His mother had left the shelter that morning around 10a and he didn&#8217;t know where his mom was.  It was now about 9 hours later and we didn&#8217;t want to leave this boy alone.  I&#8217;d already sent most of our team off to find the place where we were supposed to be sleeping, but now after searching for his mom for about 90 minutes I was at the end of what I could handle.</p>
<p>In selfish desperation, I said a short prayer&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Lord, if there&#8217;s any way possible, it&#8217;d sure be nice if this boy&#8217;s mother could show up here in the next couple of minutes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Literally about 90 seconds later I see 2 women walking in and this boy going to them.  It was the boy&#8217;s mother and aunt.  God had answered my simple prayer.  I couldn&#8217;t believe it.  The timing was just too weird to not have been God&#8217;s personal response to me.</p>
<p>So, why do I tend to only turn to God and ask for his help as a last resort?  Why do I think I have to solve things on my own and exhaust all other resources, before turning to God?  It&#8217;s either that I don&#8217;t trust him, or I&#8217;m too proud to feel like I need his help.  Either option is stupid.</p>
<p><em>Lord, help me to come to you with my daily needs.  Help me to trust and depend on you in both the little and big stuff of life.  Without you I&#8217;m not all that hot, and I need your help.</em></p>
<p><strong>Do you have any stories of when God answered a really simple prayer of yours?  Do you have trouble asking for help with the simpler needs in your life?</strong></p>
