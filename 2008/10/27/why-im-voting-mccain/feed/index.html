					<description><![CDATA[Matthew, thanks for the comments.  Here&#039;s my perspective on the questions you posed.

&lt;strong&gt;&gt; &gt; Redistribute the Wealth‚Ä¶
&gt; &lt;em&gt;Do you find that McCain is less prone to redistribution?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

I hear this idea expressed a lot, but have not been able to understand what that means.  Do you really think McCain and Republicans in general want to take advantage of the poor?  I guess what bothers me more than wealth distribution happening, is the motivation, philosophy, and desire behind it.


&lt;strong&gt;&gt; &gt; Right to Health Care‚Ä¶
&gt; &lt;em&gt;If (and it‚Äôs a *big* if) universal healthcare could be provided without decreasing quality or government spending, would it make sense for it to do so?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

That is a huge &#039;if&#039;. People talk about universal healthcare as if it hasn&#039;t already been attempted before around the world.  I don&#039;t like what I&#039;ve seen with these efforts, so it&#039;d have to be radically different than the existing attempts.

And, coming from the healthcare industry, I can attest that most of the problems with our current system are a direct result of the government&#039;s involvement through Medicare/Medicaid/Insurance and their judicial system.  I frankly want less government involvement with healthcare, rather than more.


&lt;strong&gt;&gt; &gt; World View‚Ä¶
&gt; &lt;em&gt;Do you find MaCain‚Äôs worldview to be less politically expedient?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

I&#039;m not quite sure what you mean by &#039;less politically expedient&#039;.  I do find McCain&#039;s worldview to have less potential of damaging our culture in the next 4 years of service.


&lt;strong&gt;&gt;&gt; Vague Plans‚Ä¶
&gt; &lt;em&gt;Has Obama actually had much opportunity to affect change?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

Exactly.  If he wants to be President, he needs a history of change that we can look at.

&lt;strong&gt;&gt; &lt;em&gt;Phrased differently, has he desired change that was calculated to be unattainable with his available resources? Is it morally wrong to be shrewd in one‚Äôs strategy in how best to achieve desired changes?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

I don&#039;t understand what you&#039;re saying or asking here. :(

&lt;strong&gt;&gt; &lt;em&gt;Would he be able to affect more change as President?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

Honestly, probably not.  The Presidential Office has rarely brought about real, significant change.  Congress is the place that has the most potential for affecting change.

&lt;strong&gt;&gt; &gt; I realize Obama often doesn‚Äôt actually address the core problem or have a clear solution.
&gt; &lt;em&gt;Only the Bible does that. The core problem is spiritual, not political.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

I couldn&#039;t agree more with that.

&lt;strong&gt;&gt; &lt;em&gt;But even if you reject the relevance of this, do you find that McCain does a better job of addressing the core problems and providing clear solutions?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

Yes.

&lt;strong&gt;&gt; &lt;em&gt;When you say ‚Äúcore‚Äù and ‚Äúclear‚Äù are you implying ‚Äúreal‚Äù and correct‚Äù as well?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

Not necessarily.  I&#039;m definitely not implying that all of McCain&#039;s solutions are correct.  But, from what I understand they don&#039;t move us in the wrong direction and worsen our culture.  I fear Obama&#039;s world view will weaken and demoralize us.  I sure hope I&#039;m wrong.]]></description>

&#062; Redistribute the Wealth‚Ä¶

Do you find that McCain is less prone to redistribution? Republicans have a reputation for taking from the poor (as the relative majority of citizens) and giving to the rich (either directly or indirectly). If the reputation has any merit, which redistribution is the lesser evil?


&#062; Right to Health Care‚Ä¶

If (and it&#039;s a *big* if) universal healthcare could be provided without decreasing quality or government spending, would it make sense for it to do so?
