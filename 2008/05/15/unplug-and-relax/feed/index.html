					<description><![CDATA[Tornado Warnings and severe thunderstorms last night caused me to pause in turning on my computer when I got home from work.
  
But I have to watch a movie on Netflix - nothing on tv and I need an easy distraction - so tired from a very hectic work week.
  
But I want to check my calendar for tomorrow.

I need to get some stuff done tonight on the computer!!
I feel lost - 
since the weather report indicated that the weather would probably become easier in a couple of hours, I spent the time exercising and dusting, emptying garbage, picking up and cleaning up my apt.

By the time the weather calmed down, I launched into my computer with a higher sense of accomplishment.

I back up my calendar onto cd  which isn&#039;t that helpful if I don&#039;t have a computer - da

I&#039;ve always tried to find the  ultimate organizational tool - one that didn&#039;t rely on technology - paper fold outs in a personally constructed leather unit has been a dream of mine for years - I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever fully lose that dream.
