					<description><![CDATA[Hey Sara.  I tried eBay on this, but didn&#039;t have any luck in the time frame I needed it.  Ended up finding a replacement controller from some mail order place that was an exact replacement.  I think I shorted it out by trying to bypass the fuse that is in the controller.  I knew better. :)
Hey, can you email me Steve&#039;s current email?  I haven&#039;t talked to him in ages.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you still haven&#039;t fixed it a year later... Ebay!!! The other option is to call around to churches with the system to see if they have one they aren&#039;t using. Get parents&#039; cell numbers, have them put their phone on vibrate. You can call them if they&#039;re needed. How in the world did you managed to break the thing, anyway??]]></description>
