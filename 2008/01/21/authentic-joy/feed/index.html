					<description><![CDATA[What robs me of joy in my life is worrying about the future.  Imagining worse case scenarios about what will or will not happen occupies my mind and isn&#039;t from my God, but a thief of my joy from my enemy Satan.  I&#039;m relieved to have discovered a solution to that -&quot;Taking captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ&quot; (Corinthians 10:5) Practising thinking about what I&#039;m thinking about and only allowing thoughts that are (Phil. 4:8- true, noble, right, pure, lovely, admirable, excellent, praiseworthy) lets me live in the joy and peace that God intends for me.  Praise God and Jesus - the Prince of Peace!!

					<description><![CDATA[Bill- Great post. Authentic joy... it is easy to find in children and the thing that robs that from me is feeling like I need to get &quot;everything&quot; done and not allow myself to take the time to watch our kids. One of the biggest joys of my life is watching Ben exploring how to have a relationship with God and a joy today was watching him as he perched on the end of the couch with his hands folded speaking to God asking Him why it was His decision to make the satellite go out because he (Ben) really wanted to watch a show! :) I love that he wanted to have this conversation with God!]]></description>
