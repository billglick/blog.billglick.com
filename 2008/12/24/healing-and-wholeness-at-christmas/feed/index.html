					<description><![CDATA[I agree that its easy to fall into a pattern of thinking that doesn&#039;t reflect God&#039;s capability for creating change in our lives.  My situations seem hopeless and i appreciate the reminder to remember that with God, all things are possible.  He often surprises me when I have been thinking that something will not change in a positive way.  We serve an all powerful God and its humbling to recognize when i have put him in my small box.

Thanks for posting...and thanks for the reminder...very timely.]]></description>
