					<description><![CDATA[OH might - I set here how as I listen and relisten to your prayer thoughts (crying - tears of humble pure joy)  - my! awesome and oh so very very true - I continually pray for you, EJ, RC and Rob - God sees the BIG picture and He will guide all of you - as we all continue to pray and seek His face - even if it is MESSY and not as quick as we all want.  Thanks so much for sharing this with me.  May God mold each of us into His image, to do His bidding and will.  1st Peter 5:7 &quot;Cast all your anxiety on Him because He cares for you.&quot;  Love ya]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bill, that is so good.  I love how God is working in your prayer life and my prayer is that it will draw you and Emma Jane closer to Him and it looks like it is.  We don&#039;t often see the results of our prayers because we usually want things to happen right away.  And I love how you were praying driving home and maybe while you waited for the &#039;stupid&#039; trains you were using the time to reflect on the almighty God that we have. And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.
John 1:14a... I think Jesus had some messy prayers too living side be side with people just like us and your boys.  God is good and  He knows what He is doing. Amen]]></description>
