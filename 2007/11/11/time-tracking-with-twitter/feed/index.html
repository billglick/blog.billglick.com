					<description><![CDATA[David,
I&#039;m still not real excited about the Spaz client.  I&#039;d really prefer to find another client with a much smaller footprint and less overhead.  Ideally I just want a box to pop up and ask me what I&#039;m doing.  I don&#039;t need all the extra features of Twitter in my pop up client.
Let me know if you find a simpler client like this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I installed the newest version of AIR, and Spaz doesn&#039;t like it. AIR tells me that it wants to use an older version that&#039;s no longer supported and I need to contact the author to get an updated version. 

That said, it seems to work just fine as it is. :-)]]></description>
