					<description><![CDATA[Sorry, I never did resolve this.  I ended up losing all my data and re-initialized the Drobo.
The good news is that after the 2nd initialization, this Drobo has worked fine for the past 3+ years, even after upgrading each of the drives a time or two.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[OH might - I set here how as I listen and relisten to your prayer thoughts (crying - tears of humble pure joy)  - my! awesome and oh so very very true - I continually pray for you, EJ, RC and Rob - God sees the BIG picture and He will guide all of you - as we all continue to pray and seek His face - even if it is MESSY and not as quick as we all want.  Thanks so much for sharing this with me.  May God mold each of us into His image, to do His bidding and will.  1st Peter 5:7 &quot;Cast all your anxiety on Him because He cares for you.&quot;  Love ya]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bill, that is so good.  I love how God is working in your prayer life and my prayer is that it will draw you and Emma Jane closer to Him and it looks like it is.  We don&#039;t often see the results of our prayers because we usually want things to happen right away.  And I love how you were praying driving home and maybe while you waited for the &#039;stupid&#039; trains you were using the time to reflect on the almighty God that we have. And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.
John 1:14a... I think Jesus had some messy prayers too living side be side with people just like us and your boys.  God is good and  He knows what He is doing. Amen]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Sara.  I tried eBay on this, but didn&#039;t have any luck in the time frame I needed it.  Ended up finding a replacement controller from some mail order place that was an exact replacement.  I think I shorted it out by trying to bypass the fuse that is in the controller.  I knew better. :)

					<description><![CDATA[If you still haven&#039;t fixed it a year later... Ebay!!! The other option is to call around to churches with the system to see if they have one they aren&#039;t using. Get parents&#039; cell numbers, have them put their phone on vibrate. You can call them if they&#039;re needed. How in the world did you managed to break the thing, anyway??]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree that its easy to fall into a pattern of thinking that doesn&#039;t reflect God&#039;s capability for creating change in our lives.  My situations seem hopeless and i appreciate the reminder to remember that with God, all things are possible.  He often surprises me when I have been thinking that something will not change in a positive way.  We serve an all powerful God and its humbling to recognize when i have put him in my small box.

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for mentioning my free StageConsole and miniStageConsole software. I want to point out that my software is suitable only for conventional stage lighting, not intelligent moving lights.  Extremely easy to use, though.

The Enttec USB DMX Pro interface can be found for $131 minus 5% discount at http://www.sirs-e.com
Enter save5 when asked for coupon. How can you lose at that price?

For intelligent lights, I&#039;d recommend MagicQ -- basically a Hog clone with so many improvements, that some Hog experts actually prefer it to HogPC. Software is free and works with Enttec USB DMX Pro device. Also you might like Freestyler, another free moving light software controller, sort of like Martin LightJockey.]]></description>
