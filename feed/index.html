								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Friday, Oct 15:</strong></p>
<p>After a couple of years of considering it, I finally bought a Drobo for home use.</p>
<p><strong>Monday, Oct 18:</strong></p>
<p>The Drobo (2nd generation) arrived and I set it up with my Mac Mini.  I installed 1 1TB drive and 2 500GB drives.  I set it up with HFS+ and configured email alerts, etc. as recommended. Then I started migrating data from the existing external 1TB drive.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday, Oct 19:</strong></p>
<p>Added another 1TB disk that I removed from an old Seagate external drive. Everything seemed fine as I migrated the remaining data from the still existing 1TB external drive.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday, Oct 20:</strong></p>
<p>All data had migrated to the Drobo and things had been working fine for a few hours. So, I unplugged the external drive, removed it&#8217;s 1TB Seagate drive, and replaced one of the 500GB drives with the 1TB drive.  So, at this point the Drobo has 3 1TB drives and 1 500GB drive.  The Drobo began to rebuild the Data Protection. It calculated it would take about 13 hours to complete.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/screen-shot-2010-10-20-at-63153-pm.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-233" title="Wednesday Screenshot of Drobo Dashboard" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/screen-shot-2010-10-20-at-63153-pm-300x130.png" alt="" width="300" height="130" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/screen-shot-2010-10-20-at-63153-pm-300x130.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/10/screen-shot-2010-10-20-at-63153-pm.png 1155w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Thursday, Oct 21:</strong></p>
<p>At about 6a this morning (about 12 hours after replacing the drive) I got another critical alert notification that &#8220;Drobo cannot currently protect your data against hard drive failures.&#8221;</p>
<p>At about 9a the Mac Mini that the Drobo is connected to froze, so I had to power cycle that computer. When the Mac Mini finished rebooting, the Drobo was no longer connected to the Mac Mini. After attempting to reconnect the Drobo several times, I ended up power cycling the Drobo. It came back online and showed the file system for a several minutes, despite continuing to state that &#8220;Data Protection&#8221; was still in progress.</p>
<p>Then, a few minutes later the Drobo unmounted from the Mac Mini again, but it shows up as unmounted and unformatted in the Apple Disk Utility. At that point the Drobo Dashboard started showing the Drobo&#8217;s file system is now &#8220;Unformatted&#8221; instead of it&#8217;s original &#8220;HFS+&#8221; file system.</p>
<p>I suspect that one of my drives are bad, but the Drobo never tells me that and it is still &#8220;In Progress&#8221; of rebuilding the data protection.</p>
<p>Around 7p I received a 2nd reply from Drobo support:</p>
<blockquote><p>Lets try this next then:<br />
1. Power down the computer.<br />
2. Disconnect Firewire, then power to the Drobo.<br />
3. Eject all of the drives.<br />
4. Reconnect Firewire, then power to the Drobo.<br />
5. Wait for the Drobo to connect to the Drobo Dashboard.<br />
6. Put the Drobo into standby: Drobo Dashboard &gt; Advanced Controls&#8230; &gt; Tools &gt; Standby.<br />
7. Disconnect Firewire, then power.<br />
8. Re-insert all of the drives.<br />
9. Reconnect Firewire, then USB.</p>
<p>Let me know if this enables the Drobo to complete it&#8217;s re-layout.</p></blockquote>
<p>I followed those steps exactly, except for replacing &#8220;then USB&#8221; with &#8220;then power&#8221; in step 9 (which I presumed was a typo).  3 hours later it was still showing the filesystem as &#8220;unformatted&#8221; and &#8220;appox. 1 minute remaining&#8221; on the data protection rebuild.</p>
<p><strong>Friday, Oct 22:</strong></p>
<p>Still not working and no further response from Drobo.  I&#8217;m stuck and frustrated, since I can&#8217;t really see what is happening behind the scenes with the Drobo.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="MikeGuglielmucci" src="http://chrislewisblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/blj.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180" />Studies show that approximately 45% of men are diagnosed with cancer at some point in their life. But an even bigger struggle for men is the battle with pornography. Studies show that approximately 53% of men have battled with pornography.</p>
<p>My inspiration for writing this is a worship leader that battled cancer and claimed healing from God. After becoming fairly popular from his story and his music about his battle, it was <a href="http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/pastors-secret-life-of-sin/story-0-1111117283342">revealed</a> that he didn&#8217;t actually have cancer, but had been involved in a life of lies to convince everyone around him that he was sick. As the truth came out, the true battle that he was fighting was the battle with pornography.</p>
<p>This story of lies and deception has really bugged me since I learned about it a year and a half ago. Since the truth came out, the song this guy wrote has increasingly become popular. And this popularity in light of the lies surrounding the song, has really caused conflict in my heart as I&#8217;ve sung this song. It has really agonized me.</p>
<p>But tonight I realized this guy who wrote the song was really seeking healing from his &#8216;cancer&#8217; that he was too embarrassed and ashamed to talk about. It was not a cancer of the body, but a cancer of the mind and soul. Pornography had infected him and was causing him tremendous pain. That same pain has hurt more men than any actual cancer of the body. And I can attest that God can heal men from this battle with pornography.</p>
<p>Now when I sing the song <a href="http://s0.ilike.com/play#Hillsong:Healer:96594354:s28320032.8102736.5007123.0.1.34%2Cstd_e22f9431a5a5166d278f9401b475b3f9"><strong><em>Healer</em></strong></a>, it&#8217;ll have a different meaning. It&#8217;s not just a plea for physical healing of our bodies, but a healing of our hearts, souls, and minds. Below are some of the lyrics from this plea for healing:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I believe You&#8217;re my Healer<br />
I believe You are all I need<br />
I believe You&#8217;re my Portion<br />
I believe You&#8217;re more than enough for me<br />
Jesus You&#8217;re all I need<br />
Nothing is impossible for You<br />
You hold my world in Your hands</em></p></blockquote>
<p><em><strong>God, I pray for all men that are battling pornography. I pray that they will seek your healing and support with this battle. Nothing, not even a battle with pornography, is impossible for You.</strong></em></p>

<h3><strong>Preview Your Ballot</strong></h3>
<p>Like many counties around the state, you can preview your exact ballot online at the <a href="https://www.champaigncountyclerk.com/elections/registration_status.html" target="_blank">Champaign County Clerk&#8217;s website</a>.</p>
<h3>Candidate Information:</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections_in_Illinois,_2010" target="_blank"><strong>US Senator</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_gubernatorial_election,_2010" target="_blank"><strong>Governor</strong></a></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.uselections.com/il/il.htm" target="_blank">Other State Offices</a></strong> (e.g. Lt Gov, Atty Gen, Sec St, Comptroller, Tres)<strong><br />
</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Voters Guides:</h3>
<p>Once again, I didn&#8217;t find any voters guides that were unbiased and impartial. The only voter guide that I could find online for the Illinois primary was from <a href="http://www.illinoisfamily.org/news/contentview.asp?c=34669" target="_blank">Illinois Family Institute</a> (<a href="http://www.illinoisfamily.org/content/img/f34718/ifivgdistrict-15.pdf" target="_blank">Champaign Guide</a>). This is still a useful guide, though it is biased.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Word of Caution:</strong> If you are voting the Republican primary ballot tomorrow, please consider <em><strong>not voting</strong></em> for Mark Kirk. Even though he is the predicted favorite, his voting records do not follow those of average Republicans. Please research all your candidates, even if they are predicted to win.</p>
<p><em><strong>How about you?  Do you have any other voting advice, insights, or resources?</strong></em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vgfeLat3RI">Talking Heads</a> help inspire my thoughts today, as I express what I&#8217;m most thankful for this Thanksgiving:</p>
<blockquote><p>
And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile<br />
And you may find yourself in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife<br />
And you may ask yourself: Well&#8230;How did I get here ?
</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, <em>&#8220;How did I get here?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Just one year ago this holiday wasn&#8217;t near as much fun. In fact, like most family holidays before it, it was slightly depressing. But this year I&#8217;m celebrating the holiday with MY family. Not just my parents, aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents, and other assorted family; but for the first time I&#8217;m sharing that experience with my wife and two sons. <em>Wow, that&#8217;s a great feeling.</em></p>
<p>Like the Talking Heads refer to, I do have a large automobile and beautiful house, both of which I&#8217;m thankful for. But, more so I have a beautiful <strong>wife</strong> and beautiful <strong>family</strong> (and a beautiful dog and two beautiful cats).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhT3C_9mkVI">Crosby, Stills, Nash, &#038; Young</a> helps me finish out my thought process with:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Our house is a very, very fine house<br />
With two cats in the yard<br />
Life used to be so hard<br />
Now everything is easy<br />
&#8216;Cause of you
</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Thank you God, for blessing me this year with an amazing family!  Your blessings are new every morning.  Thank you.</em></p>
<p><strong>What are you thankful for this year?  Share your thoughts as a comment.</strong></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About a month and a half ago I was driving home from somewhere and was thinking about my two boys. I was basically being impressed that I should be praying for the two guys. As I was thinking and praying about praying for them, I was hit by a deep thought that wasn&#8217;t part of me. I realized that I often pray for things to be simpler and less chaotic with my boys. &#8220;God, help tonight be an uneventful night. I don&#8217;t need extra drama tonight, so can you help things go smoothly?&#8221; Maybe you can relate to that sort of prayer.</p>
<p>Well, below is a recording of my thoughts and insights about praying for my kids. Take a quick listen.<br />
<audio class="wp-audio-shortcode" id="audio-189-2" preload="none" style="width: 100%;" controls="controls"><source type="audio/mpeg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/prayer.mp3?_=2" /><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/prayer.mp3">/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/prayer.mp3</a></audio></p>
<p><strong><em>How about you? Do you have any messy prayers for your kids?</em></strong></p>
<p>Would love to hear your thoughts in the comments.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-165" title="Bill Glick - Christmas 2008" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/photo-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/photo-300x224.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2008/12/photo.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />I&#8217;ve recently been getting back in touch with a lot of old friends that I haven&#8217;t talked to in 10-20+ years. I thought I&#8217;d post my first ever Christmas letter here to get people up to speed on my life these days.</p>
<p><strong>What Do I Do These Days?</strong></p>
<p>August of 2008 marked my fifth year of working for the <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">National Center for Supercomputing Applications </a>(NCSA) at the University of Illinois. I maintain computer systems that host lots of web sites, email services, distributed storage, and authentication services for NCSA. You may have heard in the news recently that we are now in the process of <a href="http://timelapse.ncsa.uiuc.edu">building</a> the <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/BlueWaters/">world&#8217;s largest supercomputer</a>, which is supposed to go online in 2010.</p>
<p>While I enjoy my job, my true passion is my church, <a href="http://findinggrace.com/">Grace Community Church</a>. I volunteer several hours each week there leading our TechArts teams (sound, video, production, and IT) and also help lead and serve on our board (which has been a huge task this year). For the past year and a half, Grace has been networked with <a href="http://www.lifechurch.tv/">LifeChurch.tv</a>, which is one of the most innovative and powerful churches in the US. This partnership has really excited me again about the life changing power of the local church.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights From 2008&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>In January our pastor resigned. He&#8217;d been the pastor of our church since long before I started attending 16 years ago. I helped lead the task of hiring a new pastor and leading in new ways during the transition of hiring our new pastor on July 1.</p>
<p>My dad went to Moscow and Siberia for a month-long mission trip in June &amp; July. I was pretty proud of him, since he hadn&#8217;t gone on any mission trips for a few years due to his health. He spent a lot of his time training Christian leaders there from some churches he&#8217;d help plant about 18 years ago.</p>
<p>My Mom had both of her hips replaced this summer and fall. She&#8217;s been off work for almost 6 months as she&#8217;s been rehabilitating. Things have gone great for her, but it&#8217;s made for a slow rehabilitation for a lady that&#8217;s always on the go. Since both my parents have had both hips replaced now, I think I need to schedule an appointment with an orthopedic surgeon in about 15-20 years. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>In September I became kind of a surrogate father. A friend of mine from church has 2 teenage brothers that she adopted a few years ago. The oldest one has been having some issues with her this year and they&#8217;d gotten to a point where she wasn&#8217;t comfortable with him continuing to live with her. So, R.C. has been living with me for the past few months. It&#8217;s been a really good experience for both of us.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons &amp; Growth in 2008&#8230;</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>This year I&#8217;ve realized a new confidence in how God has created me. He has created me, and that&#8217;s good. Over the years I&#8217;ve gathered a lot of wisdom, and as a result I should use it and share it. In the past I&#8217;ve normally kept quiet and not offered my opinions, but I&#8217;ve come to realize my opinions also come with years of experience and are valuable. I no longer consider myself a kid, but rather a man who God can use. I&#8217;m no longer <a href="/2008/01/08/our-deepest-fear/">afraid of greatness</a>.</li>
<li>This year I&#8217;ve also gained a new level of trust in God. At church things looked almost impossible this spring. But, I&#8217;ve been reminded that I don&#8217;t need to have all the answers. Despite me not understanding all the details, God&#8217;s got my back and I can relax and not worry. If I&#8217;m following God&#8217;s leading, He&#8217;ll take care of the details and lead us to a new place.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, anyway, that&#8217;s a brief look at God at work in my life this year. It&#8217;s funny how most of the excitement from this year was totally unexpected, but has been one of the best yet of my life. He&#8217;s still the Lord Emmanuel, God with us. I&#8217;m excited to see what new excitement is awaiting in 2009.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas!<br />
-Bill</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the last couple of days I&#8217;ve really been struck with the reality that my faith is hypocritical. I look at so many hurting lives around me and honestly believe that those lives could be miraculously made whole and complete by God. He longs to bring complete hope, healing, and restoration to His children who are hurting. I want to see that continue in the lives around me.</p>
<p>But, sometimes in my own life and those that are closer to me, I don&#8217;t honestly expect God to show up such miraculous ways. I get used to the hurting and brokenness that faces me regularly and have almost given up on the idea of God fixing those issues. I notice myself internally voicing the following kinds of things:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s just the way Joe is. He&#8217;s been sexually abused when he was young, and he&#8217;ll always react in bad ways when he&#8217;s hurt or confused.&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;Since, Mikey is young and been brought up in a dysfunctional home, I shouldn&#8217;t expect him to be as mature as other kids. He&#8217;ll always be that way.&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;I&#8217;ll always suffer from the hurt and rejection from a couple of years ago. I just have to be tough and not let that hurt bring me down at times like the holidays.&#8221;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>But, wait a minute. Didn&#8217;t I say that Jesus wanted to bring &#8216;hope, healing, and restoration to His children&#8217;? Isn&#8217;t He the blessed redeemer? Didn&#8217;t He come to seek and save the lost? Didn&#8217;t He come to bring healing and wholeness?</p>
<p><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/upGCMl_b0n4&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1&#038;rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/upGCMl_b0n4&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1&#038;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object></p>
<p>My king can bring healing to Joe, Mikey, and <em><strong>me</strong></em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Lord, continue to work in my life to bring healing and wholeness!</strong></em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/img_0060.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-84" title="IlliMex Egg Hash - Photo 3" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/img_0060-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/img_0060-225x300.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2008/11/img_0060.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a></p>
<p>Every once in a while I get a creative cooking itch that I just have to scratch.  Recently those itches have involved rice and cheese.  Tonight I wanted to explore what I could do to use up some eggs that had been in the fridge for a while.</p>
<p>As I explored the cupboards I imagined an egg and rice hash that had a bit of kick to it.  After exploring some recipes for ideas I began to create my new <strong>IlliMex Egg Hash</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>INGREDIENTS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>7 eggs</li>
<li>1 cup of milk</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce</li>
<li>3 cups of cooked rice (brown or white)</li>
<li>black pepper</li>
<li>1 15oz can of corn, drained</li>
<li>1 7oz can of green salsa verde</li>
<li>1 16oz can of diced tomatoes, drained</li>
<li>2 cups of grated cheese</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DIRECTIONS:</strong></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/img_0059.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-83" title="illiMex Egg Hash - Photo 2" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/img_0059-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/img_0059-225x300.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2008/11/img_0059.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a></p>
<ol>
<li>Blend the eggs, milk, and Worcestershire sauce in a small bowl.  Then cook the egg mixture as scrambled eggs in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
<li>Add the cooked rice and a drained can of corn to the cooked egg mixture.  Add black pepper to taste.  Brown the hash mixture for about 10 minutes over high heat.</li>
<li>Once the hash has slightly browned, mix in the salsa verde and diced tomatoes.  Simmer for about 5 minutes over medium heat.</li>
<li>Top with shredded cheese and let sit for 10-15 minutes before serving.</li>
<li>Serve over toast.</li>
</ol>
<p>Serves 4 people.</p>
<p><strong>OPTIONS TO CHANGE IT UP:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Try hash browns instead of rice.</li>
<li>Use traditional salsa or picante instead of the salsa verde and diced tomatoes.</li>
<li>Add some ham or sausage to the hash mixture.</li>
<li>Add onions or green peppers to the hash.</li>
<li>Add some Tabasco sauce for a bit more kick.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/img_0061.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-85 alignright" title="IlliMex Egg Hash - Plated" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/img_0061-300x206.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="206" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/img_0061-300x206.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2008/11/img_0061.jpg 1154w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Let me know if you try this off the cuff little hash recipe. Or shoot me ideas of ways to improve it. I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts.</p>

<p>We finally received our first of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/">new MacBooks</a> at work today.  We&#8217;re considering making this our default, preferred laptop across the organization. So, I gave it a quick trial run for about 45 minutes.</p>
<p>First, how does this keyboard feel?  I think it&#8217;s a tad bit cramped.  The response of the keys is ok, but I feel like my pinkies are held in uncomfortably tight.</p>
<p>The screen seems fine to me.  Less real estate than I&#8217;m used to, but much easier to read than my 17&#8243; high res screen.</p>
<p>The speaker response is very adequate.  A bit tinny, but fine for normal work use.</p>
<p>The track pad seems pretty natural &#8211; I forget I don&#8217;t have a button.</p>
<p>Sitting it on my lap, it feels too small for me.  But, I could get used to it.</p>
<p>The compact size and light weight make it nice for moving around the building easily.</p>
<p>The glossy screen is very nice when the display is set to bright.  But, if I&#8217;m trying to save power in a meeting by dimming the screen, the glare makes it hard to view.  But, again, I&#8217;d get used to it.</p>
<p>I plugged in the laptop to a projector in a conference room, and it worked exactly as my MBP does as far as connectivity.  Looked fine.</p>
<p>The entire machine just feels well made. While the keys look cheap, they work well. The screen is amazing and very rugged. All the metal and glass on the case feel awesome to the touch and yet extremely rugged.</p>
<p>The only problem I had with the MacBook is that my wireless internet seemed to be really slow. I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s an issue of the MacBook or if we were having problems here at the office today.</p>
<p>Overall, I think it&#8217;s a great little laptop for typical users at our office. Some developers will still prefer the 17&#8243; MBP, but it&#8217;s adequate for the majority of our Mac users.</p>

<p>For the past year and a half we&#8217;ve been lucky to have been lent a <a href="http://www.leprecon.com/product.php?id=1">Leprecon LP-X24</a> lighting control console.  This has been a really nice board, but now we&#8217;re needing to give it back to it&#8217;s owners who have another use for it.  As we move forward with expanding into some intelligent lights in the coming year, I don&#8217;t really want to spend a ton of money on a new controller which could easily cost $3,500-$10,000. So, I&#8217;m exploring some options of replacing the controller on the extreme cheap.</p>
<p>So, we currently have 24 microplex channels and 5 DMX channels, all of which are non-intelligent lights (not moving or color changing).  <a href="http://www.alltechknow.com/">Adam Callender</a> at <a href="http://gccwired.com/">Granger Community Church</a> posted a while back about how they <a href="http://www.alltechknow.com/alltechknow/2008/03/lighting-contro.html">started into a High End Hog controller system</a> by simply purchasing something like a <a href="http://www.highend.com/products/controllers/usbdmxwidget.asp">HOG 3PC DMX Widget</a> and controlling their lights using a spare computer running the <a href="http://www.highend.com/products/controllers/Hog3PC.asp">HOG 3PC Software</a>.  This option appears to cost about <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">$1200</span> $1,700 plus the cost of a computer. And presuming we went with a real <a href="http://www.highend.com/products/controllers/">HOG lighting console</a> in the future, the DMX Widget would continue to be part of that.</p>
<p>But, then that got me to thinking, &#8220;Haven&#8217;t I seen some other cheap or free software for lighting controllers?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, after a bit more searching online, it appears that we could purchase a lower end (no pun intended) <a href="http://www.enttec.com/index.php?main_menu=Products&amp;prod=70304&amp;show=description&amp;name=dmxusbpro">USB DMX Interface</a> for $151.  This would let us drive a DMX universe using software like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.chamsys.co.uk/default.asp?p=start.asp">MagicQ</a> (windows, mac, or linux)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.chromakinetics.com/DMX/StageConsole.html">StageConsole</a> (windows)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.chromakinetics.com/DMX/miniStageConsoleMac.html">miniStageConsole</a> (windows or mac)</li>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/qlc/">QLC</a> (linux)</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are two web sites that I found with some more details on cheap/free DMX control:</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.chromakinetics.com/DMX/">http://www.chromakinetics.com/DMX/</a></li>
<li> <a href="http://www.opendmx.net/">http://www.opendmx.net/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So&#8230; <strong>I&#8217;m looking for any input or experience with any of these cheap/free DMX options.</strong> At this entry price point, I&#8217;m just tempted to give several of them a try and see if they meet our needs.  But, I&#8217;d love to get feedback from others who may have already gone down this path.</p>

<p>Several people I respect have expressed they are voting for Obama, but I still don&#8217;t get what they see in him.  Yes, there are several issues that I don&#8217;t agree with McCain or Palin on.  But, when it comes down to it, I&#8217;m deeply scared about Obama becoming our president.  I&#8217;ve struggled for months to understand Obama and I can&#8217;t find any peace about electing him.</p>
<div class="gmail_quote">Below are some highlights that trouble me deeply about Obama.  I&#8217;m not even going to touch on a lot of other issues that trouble me about Obama, but rather focus it down to my core concerns.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Socialist Agenda&#8230;</span></strong><br />
<em><strong>Redistribute the Wealth&#8230; </strong></em>It&#8217;s hard to see Obama&#8217;s tax and financial policies as anything more than taking from the rich and giving it to the poor.  That&#8217;s just wrong for the government to do that.  Instead we should be encouraging everyone to prosper and reach their full potential.  And it&#8217;s morally wrong for us to create any additional sense of entitlement for those that don&#8217;t work hard.  We should be encouraging the rich to compassionately help the poor to get out of poverty, not punishing the rich for their success.</p>
<p><em><strong>Right to Health Care&#8230; </strong></em>I&#8217;m sorry, but healthcare is not an inalienable right. While it makes sense to fight pandemic diseases and maintain policies that promote health, healthcare is not a right.  The beauty of our constitution is it&#8217;s simple focus on fundamental natural, civil, and human rights.  It gives people the freedom to choose and rise to their potential.</p>
<p>OK, I know some of you are questioning my understanding of and commitment to the Gospel and it&#8217;s social significance.  I&#8217;m a huge proponent of the Church serving the social needs of the world.  And it&#8217;s a shame that the Church has done such a poor job of it that many people now think that it&#8217;s the government&#8217;s job to provide social justice to our world.  The Church needs to rise and reclaim it&#8217;s calling from Christ to care for the needy and oppressed.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">World View&#8230;<br />
</span></strong>I think it&#8217;s a bit over the top that many Christians base their entire election choice soley on abortion.  But, while abortion is not the only issue, it is very important.  How a candidate values life is a significant indicator of their world view. And Obama has a clear record of not valuing the life of unborn children and also communicating incongruent perspectives on the issue when talking to different interest groups. It also perplexes me how Obama can champion the rights of the poor to have healthcare and financial success, but yet support killing children who haven&#8217;t been born yet.  He fights for the right to healthcare of a 1 minute old baby, but not the right to life for a baby 1 minute prior to birth.  That doesn&#8217;t seem like a consistent world view.  It worries me that perhaps his policies are designed to get votes of minorities, rather than to make a right, moral decision.  What group will be next to be taken advantage of?</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Vague Plans&#8230;</span></strong><br />
Obama communicates very smoothly, but rarely ever says much of substance.  He often comes across as a broken record advocating change.  Yet, his political record in the Illinois and US senates don&#8217;t really show that he&#8217;s much of a changer.</p>
<p>I do fundamentally disagree with Obama on some issues such as Defense, Economy, Education, Foreign Policy, Healthcare, Immigration, and Taxes.  But what scares me even more is that many of his other positions on key issues sound kind of good.  When I dig deeper on these issues I agree with, I realize Obama often doesn&#8217;t actually address the core problem or have a clear solution.  He promotes generic change on a lot of issues, but has no clearly communicated plan of what that change might be.  It seems like we&#8217;re gambling that Obama&#8217;s changes might be something we agree with.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><em><strong>Your Feedback&#8230;</strong></em></span><br />
Maybe I&#8217;m missing something and am confused.  I&#8217;ve been wrong before.  So, if you have similar values as me and are an Obama supporter, I&#8217;d like to hear what your reasoning is.  Let me know your thoughts on why you are choosing Obama or McCain by posting a comment here or emailing me directly.</p>
<p>And, be sure to vote!  Don&#8217;t just listen to the polls and think the outcome is already guaranteed one way or another.</p></div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Warning: This is a technical post, mostly to document and share my experience so others interested might stumble upon it. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></em></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-73" title="airport_freeagents" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/photo-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/photo-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2008/08/photo.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />So, I purchased a couple of new <a href="http://www.seagate.com/www/en-us/products/external/freeagent_desktop_data_movers/">1TB USB hard drives</a> this week and have been trying to figure out how to best set them up for optimal speed and accessibility.  The latest setup is to connect them via USB to my <a href="http://www.apple.com/airportextreme/">Apple AirPort Extreme Basestation</a> as AirDisks.  I&#8217;ll be backing up my laptops to these drives daily (I&#8217;ll share the backup details later), so I was curious just how fast I could dump data to them.</p>
<p>How fast should I be able to copy data to the USB hard drive attached to my Airport Extreme?</p>
<ul>
<li>210 GB/hr (480 Mbps) peak from server &#8211; limit of USB 2.0 is lower than my gigabit network</li>
<li>131.8 GB/hr (300 Mbps) peak from laptop &#8211; limit of 802.11n</li>
</ul>
<p>But are those numbers realistic for average write speeds?  I&#8217;m currently averaging about 10.5 GB/hr.</p>
<p><a href="http://discussions.apple.com/message.jspa?messageID=6530505">Somebody</a> suggested that the Airport Extreme is limited to about 5 MBps (17.57 GB/hr).  This has something to do with the processor in the Airport Extreme (APEB).  Here&#8217;s what they&#8217;re experiencing:</p>
<ul>
<li>reading from APEB: 16 MBps</li>
<li>writing to APEB: 3.5 MBps average and 5-6 MBps peak</li>
</ul>
<p>3.5 MBps = 12.3 GB/hr which is about what I&#8217;m experiencing so far.  I have 4 USB disks connected to by AirPort, but I think this throughput should be for all drives combined.</p>
<p><strong>If you have a USB disk attached to a network with something like the AirPort Extreme, let me know what kind of read and write speeds you are averaging.</strong></p>
